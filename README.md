# Secure Note Taking App

This project involves building a simple console-based note-taking application that stores encrypted notes securely. The application should use HTTPS for communication, implement version control using Git, and store the notes in various data structures like Stacks, Queues, HashSet, LinkedList, and List. Additionally, utilize .NET, .NET Core, and the .NET CLI for project management.

## Features:

### User Authentication:

- Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and log out securely.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication during the authentication process.

### Note Storage:

- Implement a secure way to store notes using encryption.
- Use different data structures for note storage, such as Stacks, Queues, HashSet, LinkedList, and List.

### Version Control:

- Utilize Git for version control of the notes.
- Allow users to commit changes, view commit history, and revert to previous versions.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI):

- Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the application.
- Use the .NET CLI for project management.

### GitHub Integration:

- Connect the application to a GitHub repository for remote storage of notes.
- Push and pull changes between the local application and the GitHub repository.

## Technical Requirements:

- Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
- Utilize Git for version control. Initialize a Git repository for the project.
- Use C# and .NET for application development.
- Employ data structures such as Stacks, Queues, HashSet, LinkedList, and List for note storage.
- Develop a command-line interface using the .NET CLI for project management.
- Integrate GitHub for remote storage of notes.

## Learning Goals:

- Understanding and implementing secure communication using HTTPS.
- Hands-on experience with Git for version control.
- Application of various data structures for practical problems.
- Familiarity with command-line interface development using .NET CLI.
- Integration of a project with GitHub for collaborative development.

Feel free to customize the project based on your interests and expand its features as needed. This project should provide a good mix of security, version control, data structures, and practical application development with C#.
